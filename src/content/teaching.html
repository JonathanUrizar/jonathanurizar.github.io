<h2 id="page-title">Teaching</h2>
<p>It is my firm belief that every student should be entitled to a quality education in music. If a student has the strong desire to learn and excel in music, he or she can attain any goal they set in mind. As an educator, I strive to teach a student to perform at a highly proficient technical level, but more importantly,  I promote the overall effect of the work from a musical standpoint. Every note is the most important note you'll ever play. </p>
